# Predictive-Maintaince-of-Sensors-in-UAVs
Developing anamoly detection of sensors in UAVs, major sensors like IMU sensors, Temperature sensor, pressure sensor. Using real time flight data obtained by ROS to CSV 
The dataset we used was collected from ROS (Robot Operating System) topics, which naturally contain raw and unprocessed information. This includes duplicated columns, noisy measurements, and metadata that is not useful for modelling. To make this data usable, we cleaned it by removing repeated fields, getting rid of irrelevant information, and aligning the different sensor streams using their sequence numbers. This ensured that each row in the dataset represented a consistent snapshot 
of the drone’s state. After cleaning, we applied feature engineering to improve the dataset. Rolling mean and rolling standard deviation features were created to capture smooth trends and short-term variability. We also added z-score features, which helped standardize each sensor value and show how much a reading deviated from normal behavior. These features made the dataset more informative and prepared it for machine-learning analysis. Using this processed data, we explored unsupervised models like Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM to detect anomalies in unlabeled data, and a supervised logistic regression model to classify behaviors based on labeled temperature readings. These steps form the starting point for developing a complete predictive maintenance approach for drones.
